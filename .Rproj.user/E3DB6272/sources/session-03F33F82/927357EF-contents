 doi={10.18637/jss.v076.i01},
 abstract={Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

From the practitioners' point of view, we believe that this approach presents a computationally convenient way for implementation of the OIZTNB regression model.},

abstract = {Abstract One-inflation in zero-truncated count data has recently found considerable attention. There are currently two views in the literature. In the first approach, the untruncated model is considered as one-inflated whereas in the second approach the truncated model is viewed as one-inflated. Here, we show that both models have identical model spaces as well as identical maximum likelihoods. Consequences of population size estimation are illuminated, and the findings are illustrated at hand of two case studies.}

abstract = {Abstract The identification and treatment of “one-inflation” in estimating the size of an elusive population has received increasing attention in capture–recapture literature in recent years. The phenomenon occurs when the number of units captured exactly once clearly exceeds the expectation under a baseline count distribution. Ignoring one-inflation has serious consequences for estimation of the population size, which can be drastically overestimated. In this paper we propose a Bayesian approach for Poisson, geometric, and negative binomial one-inflated count distributions. Posterior inference for population size will be obtained applying a Gibbs sampler approach. We also provide a Bayesian approach to model selection. We illustrate the proposed methodology with simulated and real data and propose a new application in official statistics to estimate the number of people implicated in the exploitation of prostitution in Italy.},
