  In this paper we provide an overview of R packages that allow fitting various single-source capture-recapture (SSCR) models. In general, SSCR approaches assume that capture history follows certain discrete distribution (e.g. negative binomial, poisson, one-inflated poisson) but the observational data consist of only positive counts i.e. we observe zero truncated distributions. In this paper we cover both frequentist and bayesian approach, provide functions for population size estimation as well as analytical and bootstrap estimators. The paper focus on `extraDistr`, `countreg`, `VGAM` and `brms` packages that are suited for the SSCR models.

## Introduction

Introductory section which may include references in parentheses [@R], or cite a reference such as @R in the text.

## Single-source capture-recapture models

@Bohning2022

## R package for single-source capture-recapture model

This section may contain a figure such as Figure \ref{fig:Rlogo}.

```{r, Rlogo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The logo of R.', out.width='2in', fig.align='center', fig.pos='htbp'}
knitr::include_graphics('Rlogo.pdf')
```

### Truncated discrete distributions

In order to use truncated distributions we may use default functions truncaed at 0 

Loading required packages

```{r}
library(extraDistr)
library(countreg)
library(VGAM)
library(brms)
library(numDeriv)
```

### extraDistr

```{r}
library(extraDistr)
set.seed(123)
```

### countreg

`countreg` package includes function `zerotrunc`

### VGAM

The most advanced

### stan and brms

## Case studies

There will likely be several sections, perhaps including code snippets, such as:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
plot(x)
```
