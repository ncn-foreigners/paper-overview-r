## Introduction

Introductory section which may include references in parentheses [@R], or cite a reference such as @R in the text.

## Single-source capture-recapture models


## R package for single-source capture-recapture model

This section may contain a figure such as Figure \ref{fig:Rlogo}.

```{r, Rlogo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The logo of R.', out.width='2in', fig.align='center', fig.pos='htbp'}
knitr::include_graphics('Rlogo.pdf')
```

## Case studies

There will likely be several sections, perhaps including code snippets, such as:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
plot(x)
```
