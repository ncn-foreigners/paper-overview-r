## Introduction

Introductory section which may include references in parentheses [@R], or cite a reference such as @R in the text.

## Single-source capture-recapture models


## Section title in sentence case

This section may contain a figure such as Figure \ref{fig:Rlogo}.

```{r, Rlogo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The logo of R.', out.width='2in', fig.align='center', fig.pos='htbp'}
knitr::include_graphics('Rlogo.pdf')
```

## Another section

There will likely be several sections, perhaps including code snippets, such as:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
plot(x)
```

## Summary

This file is only a basic article template. For full details of *The R Journal* style and information on how to prepare your article for submission, see the [Instructions for Authors](https://journal.r-project.org/share/author-guide.pdf).

### About this format and the R Journal requirements

`rticles::rjournal_article` will help you build the correct files requirements:

-   A R file will be generated automatically using `knitr::purl` - see <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/purl.html> for more information.
-   A tex file will be generated from this Rmd file and correctly included in `RJwapper.tex` as expected to build `RJwrapper.pdf`.
-   All figure files will be kept in the default rmarkdown `*_files` folder. This happens because `keep_tex = TRUE` by default in `rticles::rjournal_article`
-   Only the bib filename is to modifed. An example bib file is included in the template (`RJreferences.bib`) and you will have to name your bib file as the tex, R, and pdf files.
